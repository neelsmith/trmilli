# `trmilli`

A repository of archaeological and epigraphic data for the study of ancient Lycia.

Original editions of Lycian inscriptions are drawn from Dane Scott's coordinated project at <https://descot21.github.io/Lycian/>.


## Interactive notebooks

The `pluto` directory includes Pluto notebooks you can run locally to use the data in this repository.  

In addition, you can run a Pluto notebook supporting typing Lycian Unicode either locally or [on `binder.org`](https://binder.plutojl.org/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fneelsmith%252Ftrmilli%252Fmaster%252Fpluto%252Ftranscoder.jl)
